        <h2>Work and Travel = Cultural Exchange</h2>
        <p>Work and Travel is the popular name for the largest group of cultural exchange programs organized 
            in the United States under the supervision of the Department of State. The most widely known 
            Work and Travel program is Camp America, a program designed especially for people going to the 
            US for the first time. It has been organized for 50 years by the American Institute of Foreign Studies. 
            Like any Work and Travel program, Camp America is an opportunity for cultural exchange between participants 
            and those coming to the camp, including American and international camp staff. This takes place during joint work, 
            sports and recreational activities. Work and Travel also gives you the opportunity to get to know the everyday 
            life of US residents.

            <h2>What is Work and Travel?</h2>
            
            Work and Travel is the organization of cultural exchange combining 
            holidays with the possibility of legal work. Thousands of students 
            from thousands of countries around the world take part in it. 
            The program is based on a J-1 visa. This is called Exchange visitor visa
             - a visa for a participant in a cultural exchange program. It is not a work, 
             student or tourist visa, but thanks to it, it is possible to work in the USA 
             for summer work for students and people who want to work with young people as 
            educators or sports instructors.

            The popularity of Work and Travel programs, and Camp America in 
            particular, lies not only in the fact that they make it possible to 
            vacation and work in the USA and travel around America.

            <h2>You don't worry about anything!</h2>
            
            In the "safe version of work and travel", as some people call 
            Camp America, the participant remains under the care of the 
            organizer from the moment of registering in Poland until the end 
            of participation in the program. Free flight, airport pickup, camp site, 
            pocket money, free living and dining are guaranteed by a contract 
            concluded directly with Camp America. Therefore, the low own 
            contribution means that the financial risk on the part of the 
            Participant is practically non-existent. The participant is also 
            provided with a double "Orientation", that is, a special training on 
            participation in the program: before departure from country and upon 
            arrival at the camp. The program oversees the American Institute of Foreign 
            Studies and provides Camp America funding for full-service attendee support.
